# MCTS for Tic-Tac-Toe

This repository implements Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe. MCTS is a powerful decision-making algorithm used for making optimal moves in games by balancing exploration and exploitation during its search process.

## Features
* Full Tic-Tac-Toe Implementation: Play Tic-Tac-Toe with MCTS as the decision engine.
* Pluggable Players: Play against an AI, or have two AIs play against each other (in progress).
* Visualization: Print the game board to track moves in real time.
* Customizable MCTS Parameters: Adjust the number of simulations, exploration depth, and more.
